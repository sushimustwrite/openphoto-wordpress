### OpenPhoto plugin for WordPress

#### Installation

To install this plugin drag the openphoto-wordphp folder and the file openphoto-wordpress.php into your `wp-content/plugins` directory. You can also download the plugin from <a href="https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/openphoto/">the WordPress plugin directory</a>.

#### Connecting WordPress to OpenPhoto

Go to *Settings->OpenPhoto* and enter the name of your OpenPhoto URL. This is something like *http://current.openphoto.me*.

Clicking *Save Changes* will take you to your OpenPhoto site. Log in, create an app through your Settings page, and grant your blog access to that app. Once complete you'll be redirected back to your WordPress site.

#### Adding photos into your blog posts

Click the Add Media icon like you normally would and then select the *OpenPhoto* tab. Here you can filter by tags and select the photo to embed into your post.
